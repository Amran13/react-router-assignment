  "review": "In George Orwell's dystopian masterpiece, 1984, we are transported to a totalitarian society ruled by the all-seeing Big Brother. Through the eyes of Winston Smith, a low-ranking member of the Party, we witness the oppressive surveillance, thought control, and propaganda that dominate every aspect of life.
